Nf3 has the benefit of preventing Black's 1...e5 reply, which is a move that Black likes to play for all the same reasons that White likes to play 1. e4.

Black can respond with 1...d5 (Dutch variation) or 1...e5 (From’s Gambit); if White accepts the gambit, it creates more kingside weakness, and White must play carefully as a mate is easily seen with 2…d6 3. exd6 Bxd6 4.
